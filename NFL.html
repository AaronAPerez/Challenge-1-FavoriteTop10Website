              76.3% of his throws and tossed four touchdown passes to push the Eagles past the Washington Commanders. It

                tied
                for the league lead with eight interceptions -- which is on pace for 17 interceptions, and that would
                easily
                surpass the worst of his career (13). With 15 touchdown passes, Mahomes is on pace for a
                touchdown-to-interception ratio of less than 2-to-1, which would also be a career worst. Mahomes has
                always
                been above that mark, in some seasons well beyond it</p>

                TDs, 4
                INTs -- but he's playing consistently good football. He has had a passer rating of at least 90 or better
                in
                his past five games (a career-high streak) and has posted a passer rating of 90 or above in six of the
                team's
                eight games. He's still making some of those young quarterback mistakes, like his end zone interception
                on a
                ball he should have thrown away, and he tries to keep plays alive too long (a major reason for his six
                fumbles), but Doug Pederson has praised Lawrence's leadership, his toughness (he's playing on a sprained
                left
                knee) and the clutch throws and plays he has made during the Jaguars' 5-0 stretch in October.</p>

                delivering big gains on the ground. His 380 yards rushing tops all quarterbacks. Jackson's playmaking
                ability
                is why Baltimore is tied for the best record in the AFC and holds a 1Â½-game lead in the AFC North</p>

                legs, not just with his running but buying time outside the pocket to make off-script plays. As he has
                gotten
                more comfortable with Mike McCarthy as the playcaller, he has been able to find his way in certain
                situations.
                Prescott has three games this year in which he has completed at least 80% of his passes, but some of
                that was
                due to quick, shorter throws. Against the Rams on Sunday, he was 7-of-9 for 133 yards and three
                touchdowns on
                passes of 10 or more air yards in the first half. When Prescott completes more than half of his throws
                of 10
                yards or more, the Cowboys are 4-0 this year, per ESPN Stats & Information.</p>

                extension talks with Immanuel Quickley, it will be a fascinating summer in Gotham, as the Knicks weigh
                what
                direction to take as they hope to build off this past season's successes.</p>
